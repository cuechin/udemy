	- Pass data from a parent to a child

	- One way flow of data. Child can't push props back up.
	- Like 25% of understanding React.
* Communication with Props
	1. Add attributes to a JSX element.
	2. React collects the attributes and puts them in an object.
	3. Props object shows up as the first argument to the child component function.
	4. We use the props however we wish.
